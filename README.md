# CurioBTs
Repository for using Behavior Trees on the Ramona the Rover (she's a Curio rover). 
The files are divided into two folders, one is for running the simulation and the other is for running the physical system.
A full tutorial on how to get the rover up and running shall be included shortly. 
If you are a student working on this project and you need some help feel free contact me at: jadrina.deandrade@etu.emse.fr.
